# v0 Verification Project

This folder contains a minimal Next.js app configured to verify the `animated-emoji-4v` library in v0.

## Instructions


**IMPORTANT**:
I have included a `lib` folder with the library code INSIDE this project (vendored).
This ensures 100% success on v0 without worrying about GitHub/NPM connectivity.

1.  **Download** this folder or zip it.
2.  **Upload** ALL files (including `lib` folder and `package.json`) to v0.
3.  **Run** it.
