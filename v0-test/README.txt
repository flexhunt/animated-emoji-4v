# v0 Verification Project

This folder contains a minimal Next.js app configured to verify the `animated-emoji-4v` library in v0.

## Instructions

1.  **Download** this folder or zip it from your computer.
2.  **Upload** ALL files (especially `package.json`) to v0.
    *   If you just paste code, v0 tries to guess dependencies and fails.
    *   You MUST upload the `package.json` so it knows to fetch from GitHub.
3.  **Run** it.

It acts as a "Proof of Concept" that the library installs correctly from GitHub.
